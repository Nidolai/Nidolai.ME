## My First Blog Post ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to my personal blog, this will be my small area on the big internet.
Here I'll write about tech, programming and other things i find interesting.

## About Me
My name is Nicolai and currently, I'm working as a DevOps Engineer where I maintain and create CI/CD pipelines for .NET, React, and containers, deployment environments among other things.
I work a lot with automation and scripting mainly using PowerShell but other languages tend to pop up here and there.

When I'm working the main goal I set for myself is: _To make the day just a bit easier and better for developers or in other words a developer's favorite developer._
To achieve this most of my working day is spent on Azure DevOps, Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code, and of course, being by the coffee machine, I'm working in software development after all.

I like to help, teach and guide people, so you might see a few blog posts about Azure Pipelines in the future.
If you have any questions about Azure DevOps, feel free to reach out using my mail in the footer.

In my spare time, I like to play video games and do some spare time programming on my ever-growing list of side projects, someday I'll finish at least one of them ðŸ¤ž.
Thanks for taking some time out of your day to read a bit about me. I look forward to writing the next blog post.
